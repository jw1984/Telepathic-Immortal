# Telepathic Immortal

**Telepathic Immortal** is an experimental game and simulation project exploring
atmospheric signal control, hovering aerial robotics, and six-directional movement
systems inspired by real astrophysical environments.

The project investigates how an autonomous, non-biological intelligence could
navigate, sense, and act within complex electromagnetic and atmospheric systems.
Gameplay systems focus on:

- Six-vector aerial movement (hex-directional control)
- Signal-based sensing and navigation
- Hostile environments shaped by interference, fog, and energy fields
- Modular enemy and world systems designed for expansion

The fictional universe associated with this project draws inspiration from
real astronomy (e.g., gas giants, magnetospheres, multi-moon systems) but is
presented strictly as **science-fiction world-building**.

⚠️ **Important**  
The narrative universe, lore, names, factions, and story elements are **not open-source**.
Contributors are welcome to extend the *codebase*, but must create **original,
independent narrative content** for any derivative projects unless a separate
