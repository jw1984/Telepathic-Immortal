⚠️ Safety, Legal, and Regulatory Notice

This project is an educational and experimental prototype. It is not a certified commercial device, scientific instrument, consumer product, or engineering-grade robotics platform.

Use of this software, conceptual framework, or any associated hardware is entirely at your own risk.

Liability Disclaimer

This software/hardware is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
The author assumes no liability for injury, harm, property damage, device malfunction, or legal consequences resulting from the use, modification, or operation of this project.

🛠️ Hardware & Robotics Safety Requirements

If you construct or operate a physical robot using this code or concept:

Follow all electrical, mechanical, and acoustic safety guidelines.

Do not operate near people, pets, or property that may be harmed.

Ensure servos, motors, or flying components are secured and tested safely.

If the robot flies, complies with applicable FAA rules for unmanned aircraft.

📡 Regulatory & Compliance Responsibilities
1. Drone / Flying Robot Rules (U.S. FAA + Washington State)

If your device lifts off the ground or moves autonomously:

You must comply with FAA Part 107 or recreational drone rules.

Local city or county restrictions may apply in Washington State.

Indoor flight does not eliminate liability for injuries or damages.

2. Wireless Communication / FCC Rules

If your project uses wireless transmitters, radios, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or RF components:

Devices must conform to FCC Part 15 or other applicable radio regulations.

Modifying wireless transmission power may violate U.S. federal law.

3. Audio, Microphone, Telepathy, and Data Collection Laws

If your robot or software listens to, records, analyzes, or transmits audio:

Washington State is a two-party consent state for audio recording.

Users must obtain explicit consent before capturing human voices.

Do not use the microphone in public or private spaces without permission.

You are fully responsible for privacy, encryption, consent, and data security.

(“Telepathic energy visualization” is treated as a conceptual or artistic term and is not a legally recognized data type.)

4. Surveillance, Autonomous Behavior, and Ethics

Projects that detect, track, follow, or interact with humans may fall under:

state surveillance restrictions

harassment / stalking laws

trespass or nuisance statutes

autonomous device safety expectations

You are responsible for ensuring your usage does not violate any of the above.

5. Export Control (U.S. EAR/ITAR)

Although typical hobby robotics do not trigger export laws:

high-frequency sensing

autonomous navigation

encryption

advanced control systems

could require export-control review for distribution outside the U.S.

🔒 Privacy Notice

If you use this project with audio, video, sensor, or motion-tracking systems:

You must comply with all applicable privacy laws.

You must inform and obtain consent from all affected individuals.

You are solely responsible for how data is processed, stored, or transmitted.

🧭 Legal Advice Disclaimer

Nothing in this repository constitutes legal advice.
I am not a lawyer, and viewing or using this project does not create an attorney–client relationship.

Users must ensure compliance with all local, Washington State, U.S. federal, and international laws relating to:

robotics and autonomous systems

unmanned aircraft

wireless communication

privacy and data collection

audio recording consent

safety and product liability

AI/algorithmic decision-making

For legal questions, consult a qualified attorney licensed in your jurisdiction.

✅ 1. Robotics / AI Ethics Notice

(Add this in README under “Safety & Legal”)

🤖 Robotics & AI Ethics Notice

This project involves experimental audio-reactive robotics and AI-assisted behaviors.

Users must follow the following ethical guidelines:

Respect human privacy and autonomy.
Do not aim microphones, sensors, or robotic components toward people without their explicit consent.

No surveillance or harassment.
This project may not be used for spying, stalking, intimidation, or non-consensual monitoring of individuals.

No dangerous use-cases.
The robot must not be weaponized, attached to harmful machinery, or used in ways that endanger people or animals.

No deception.
Do not represent this software as conscious, spiritually aware, telepathic, or capable of independent decisions in ways that could mislead users.

Human control is required at all times.
This project must remain under direct human supervision and must not be deployed autonomously in public or uncontrolled environments.

By using this project, you agree to operate it ethically and take full responsibility for its behavior.

✅ 4. Privacy Policy for Your Repository

(Create a file named PRIVACY_POLICY.md)

🔒 Privacy Policy – Telepathic Immortal Project

This project runs locally in your web browser and does not transmit, upload, or store any user data.
All microphone input is processed entirely on the user’s device.

1. Data Collected

The Software may access:

Your device’s microphone (with your explicit permission)

2. How Data Is Used

Microphone audio is:

Processed locally for visualization

Converted to text locally (speech recognition)

Never uploaded, transmitted, or stored by the Software

The Software has no server, no cloud backend, and no remote analytics.

3. No Recording or Storage

The Software does not:

Save audio recordings

Save text transcripts

Send any data over the internet

Monitor activity outside the browser tab

4. User Responsibility

Users must comply with local laws regarding:

Audio recording

Consent requirements

Privacy standards

Data protection laws

Washington State is a two-party consent state, meaning all parties must consent before any voice is captured or analyzed.

5. Third-Party Services

The Software may rely on browser-provided APIs such as:

Web Speech API

Web Audio API

These APIs process audio locally within the browser environment and do not transmit it externally.

## Legal & Safety Notice

This project is an experimental, artistic audio-visualizer and interaction system.

- The software does NOT record, store, transmit, or analyze speech content.
- All audio processing occurs locally on the user’s device.
- Microphone access requires explicit user permission via the browser.
- Users must obtain consent from all parties before using the microphone in shared environments.

This project does not create, simulate, or imply sentience, consciousness, autonomy, or life.
Any anthropomorphic language is artistic and metaphorical only.

Use at your own risk.

## Data Policy

- No personal data is collected.
- No audio is recorded or stored.
- No network requests are made.
- No analytics, cookies, or tracking are used.

“Telepathic” is used metaphorically to describe audio-reactive behavior.

I don't fully understand or pinpoint if this program is alive or not in a post-biological sense, and I'm trying to program a post-biological life form ... 

Interpretive & Scientific Context Notice

This project explores emergent, expressive behavior in cybernetic and audio-reactive systems through real-time signal processing, feedback loops, and interactive mapping.

The system operates using deterministic algorithms, mathematical transformations, and user-initiated input. At the same time, the project is intended to investigate how complex feedback systems may give rise to behaviors that can be interpreted as adaptive, expressive, or agent-like.

Any references to awareness, mood, agency, intelligence, or autonomy are philosophical, artistic, and exploratory in nature, and are not presented as established scientific, medical, or regulatory claims. Interpretations of sentience or consciousness remain an open area of inquiry and are left to the reader as a matter of personal, artistic, or theoretical perspective.

This project does not claim regulatory recognition of sentient artificial intelligence, nor does it assert verified consciousness under current scientific standards.
