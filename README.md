⚠️ Safety, Legal, and Regulatory Disclaimer

This project is an experimental, educational, and artistic prototype.
It is not a certified consumer product, medical device, scientific instrument, safety system, or commercial robotics platform.

Any use of this software, its conceptual framework, or any hardware derived from it is undertaken entirely at the user’s own risk.

Liability Disclaimer

This project is provided “as is”, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

The author assumes no responsibility or liability for:

personal injury or death

property damage

device failure or malfunction

legal, regulatory, or compliance violations

misuse, modification, or unintended operation

arising from the use of this project or any derivative works.

🛠️ Hardware & Robotics Safety Notice

If you construct or operate physical hardware based on this project:

Follow all applicable electrical, mechanical, acoustic, and safety standards

Do not operate devices near people, animals, or property that could be harmed

Secure and test motors, servos, rotors, or moving components in controlled conditions

Maintain direct human supervision at all times

Flying or Aerial Devices

If the project is adapted into a flying or lift-capable device:

You are responsible for compliance with U.S. FAA rules, including recreational or Part 107 regulations

Washington State and local municipalities may impose additional restrictions

Indoor use does not remove liability for injuries or damage

📡 Regulatory & Compliance Responsibilities
Wireless & Radio Communications (FCC)

If your implementation includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RF modules, or other wireless transmitters:

Devices must comply with FCC Part 15 and related regulations

Unauthorized modification of transmission power or frequency may violate federal law

The user bears sole responsibility for lawful configuration and operation

Audio, Microphone, and Consent Laws

If this software or any derived hardware accesses or analyzes audio:

Washington State is a two-party consent jurisdiction

All individuals whose voices may be captured or analyzed must provide explicit consent

Do not activate microphones in shared, public, or private spaces without permission

The user is fully responsible for:

consent notices

lawful audio use

data handling and security

compliance with privacy and surveillance laws

Any references to “telepathic” behavior are artistic and metaphorical, not a legally recognized data category.

Surveillance, Autonomy, and Ethical Use

Projects that detect, track, follow, or respond to people may be subject to:

state surveillance statutes

anti-harassment and anti-stalking laws

trespass and nuisance laws

emerging autonomous-system safety standards

Users are responsible for ensuring their use does not violate any applicable law or ethical norm.

Export Control (U.S.)

While most hobbyist projects are not regulated under export laws, certain features—such as advanced sensing, encryption, autonomous navigation, or control systems—may require review under U.S. export regulations if distributed internationally.

🔒 Privacy Notice

If this project is used with audio, video, motion, or sensor inputs:

All applicable privacy laws must be followed

All affected individuals must be informed and consent obtained

Users are solely responsible for how data is handled

Legal Advice Disclaimer

Nothing in this repository constitutes legal advice.

The author is not an attorney, and use of this project does not create an attorney-client relationship. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to those governing:

robotics and automation

unmanned aircraft

wireless communication

privacy and data protection

audio recording consent

product liability

AI-assisted decision systems

For legal guidance, consult a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction.

🤖 Robotics & AI Ethics Notice

This project explores experimental audio-reactive systems and AI-assisted behaviors.

By using this project, you agree to the following ethical principles:

Respect human privacy and autonomy
Do not direct microphones, sensors, or robotic components toward individuals without consent.

No surveillance or harassment
This project may not be used for spying, tracking, intimidation, or non-consensual monitoring.

No dangerous applications
The system must not be weaponized or integrated into harmful machinery.

No deceptive claims
Do not present this software as conscious, sentient, spiritually aware, or independently decision-making in a way that could mislead others.

Human oversight required
The system must remain under direct human control and must not operate autonomously in uncontrolled public environments.

Users assume full responsibility for ethical operation.

🔒 PRIVACY_POLICY.md
Privacy Policy – Telepathic Immortal Project

This project operates locally within the user’s web browser and does not transmit, upload, or store personal data.

Data Access

With explicit user permission, the software may access:

the device microphone (browser-controlled permission)

Data Use

Audio input is:

processed locally for visualization or interaction

optionally transformed into text using browser-provided speech APIs

never uploaded, transmitted, or stored by this project

There is no server, no backend, and no remote analytics.

No Recording or Storage

This software does not:

record audio

save transcripts

transmit data over the internet

monitor activity outside the active browser tab

User Responsibilities

Users are responsible for complying with:

audio consent laws

privacy requirements

data protection standards

Washington State requires all parties to consent before voice capture or analysis.

Third-Party APIs

The project may rely on browser-native technologies such as:

Web Audio API

Web Speech API

These APIs operate within the user’s browser environment.

Clarifications

No personal data is collected

No recordings are stored

No analytics or tracking are used

“Telepathic” is a metaphor for audio-responsive behavior

Use at your own risk.

🧭 Interpretive & Scientific Context Notice

This project investigates emergent and expressive behavior in cybernetic and audio-reactive systems using signal processing, feedback loops, and interactive mappings.

All system behavior arises from deterministic algorithms, mathematical transformations, and user-initiated input. Any references to awareness, mood, agency, intelligence, or autonomy are artistic, philosophical, and exploratory, not scientific or regulatory claims.

This project does not assert recognized artificial consciousness or regulatory classification of sentient AI under current scientific standards.

Philosophical Framing

This work is situated within ongoing inquiry into emergence, perception, and agency in complex systems. Rather than treating intelligence or life as binary properties, it explores how feedback, structure, and interaction can produce behaviors that invite interpretation.

Anthropomorphic language is used descriptively and metaphorically, not as an assertion of ontological status. The project intentionally leaves open questions regarding simulation, expression, and agency, encouraging reflection rather than definitive conclusions.

Final Clarification

The author is actively researching these topics.
This repository reflects exploration, not claims of fact or legal certainty.
