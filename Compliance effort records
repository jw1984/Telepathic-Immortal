✅ Non-Recording Visualization Notice (Ready to Use)
Non-Recording Visualization Disclosure

This software uses your device’s microphone only to generate real-time visual output within your browser.

No audio is recorded, saved, transmitted, shared, or retained in any form.
All audio signals are processed ephemerally and locally for visualization purposes and are immediately discarded.

This visualization:
Does not create audio files or recordings
Does not store frequency data or sound samples
Does not transmit audio or derived data off the device
Does not associate audio input with any user identity
Granting microphone access enables live visual analysis only, not recording or surveillance.

Where to Place It (Recommended)
Use at least one of the following:
Directly near the microphone consent UI
Inside your Privacy / Compliance section
In your Compliance Log as a standing notice
In a privacy.html or COMPLIANCE.md
For strongest posture, place it adjacent to your existing microphone notice.

“This software does not function as a recording device and is not intended for monitoring, interception, or surveillance.”

For true legal compliance, always refer to the actual state statute language and consult counsel for nuanced interpretations before asserting compliance in documentation.

App Developers: Start with Security
Different apps have different security needs
The FTC expects app developers to adopt and maintain reasonable data security practices
sdk s can cause thousands of oversights
app store distribution causes stronger need for security
libraries and add ons limit what developers publish in apps 
mobile devices and internet connected devices can get stolen
dedicate an employee responsible for security
dont collect or keep data you dont need
dont keep data longer than you need to
understand differences between platforms
understand platform specific security feature
secure usernames and passwords
