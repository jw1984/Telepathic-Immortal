NIST research (starting point)

Began reviewing the NIST knowledge base as part of ongoing compliance and security documentation for the project.

NIST research (new technology + manufacturing profile)

Continued NIST knowledge base review using the search term “new technology.”

Read and noted key concepts from:

Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) Manufacturing Profile

Low Impact Level Example materials

Implementation resources, including:

Volume 3 — Discrete-based Manufacturing System Use Case

FTC / COPPA research + children’s privacy disclosures
FTC search research link:
https://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=ftc_prod&query=privacy+policy+audio+collection+no+recording&commit=Search

Reviewed FTC consumer education content related to privacy policy expectations and special protections for children online.

Read: “Protecting Your Child’s Privacy Online” (COPPA guidance) and extracted practical disclosure requirements and parent-facing notice concepts.

FTC COPPA consumer page referenced:

✅ COPPA Notice (Original / Ready to Use)

Children’s Privacy (COPPA Notice)
This software is built for a general audience and is not specifically designed for children under 13.

Telepathic Wind Robot — Cyber-Mystic Analyzer does not intentionally collect, store, transmit, or process personal information from children under 13 (as defined by COPPA).

Current behavior of the software:

No account creation required

No requests for name, email, or personal identifiers

Microphone input is used only for live, local, in-browser visualization

No audio is recorded, saved, uploaded, or shared

Audio signals exist only temporarily in memory and are discarded immediately

If you are under 13:
Do not enable the microphone or use microphone-based features.

If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child used this software in a way that could involve personal information:
Stop using the software immediately. The current design does not retain user data.

General-purpose statement:
This software is intended for experimentation and visualization and is not a recording or monitoring tool.

⚠️ Technical warning (COPPA trigger list)

If the project later adds any of the following, COPPA review and disclosures must be revisited:

Saving audio (files or recordings)

Storing frequency/analysis data tied to sessions or identities

User accounts, profiles, or logins

Analytics tied to IP/device identifiers

Cloud logging or remote storage

“Share” / export / social publishing features that transmit user-related data

Current safety posture:

Processing is local-only

Data is not persisted

Nothing is transmitted off-device

“AI dump” compliance expansion (journal style, original phrasing)

Expanded compliance research notes for the Telepathic Immortal project, including privacy, disclosures, and best-practice alignment (non-exhaustive, ongoing).

Frameworks / areas reviewed and mapped into project documentation:

— U.S. Federal Privacy & Consumer Protection —

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concepts reviewed:

Privacy and data security guidance

“Truth in advertising” as it applies to software claims and user-facing statements

Clear-and-conspicuous disclosure expectations

Consent clarity and avoidance of deceptive UI practices (dark-pattern risk)

Accuracy in describing microphone/audio behavior (recording vs. visualization vs. transmission)

COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) considerations reviewed:

General-audience vs. child-directed positioning

What “collection” means and what counts as personal information

Real-time processing vs. storage/retention concerns

Ensuring disclosures match actual technical behavior

Avoiding identity-linked audio or analytics

State audio consent model (working reference list; verify statutes before making formal legal claims):

All-party / two-party consent states (often cited): CA, CT, DE, FL, IL, MD, MA, MI, MT, NV, NH, OR (mixed), PA, VT, WA

One-party consent states (often cited): AL, AK, AZ, AR, CO, GA, HI (limited), ID, IN, IA, KS, KY, LA, ME, MN, MS, MO, NE, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VA, WV, WI, WY

(Note: this list is a working summary; legal requirements vary by context and can change.)

FTC privacy/security guidance review
FTC privacy and security hub:
https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Reviewed FTC guidance emphasizing that organizations must follow the privacy promises they make to users (i.e., “say what you do, and do what you say”).

Logged key principle: privacy statements become commitments—misstatements can create enforcement risk.

Health Breach Notification Rule page:
https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/health-breach-notification-rule

Reviewed HBN Rule overview and noted relevance primarily to health apps / health data and certain related services.

Captured the general takeaway: breach-related duties depend on the type of data and whether it qualifies as covered health information under FTC scope.

FTC Consumer Privacy guidance:
https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/consumer-privacy

Reviewed FTC guidance reinforcing:

honoring privacy policies and user disclosures

aligning representations with actual practices

understanding FTC Act enforcement themes (deception/unfairness)

heightened sensitivity around health-related data and breach-related expectations

✅ Non-Recording Visualization Disclosure (Original / Ready to Use)

Non-Recording Visualization Notice
This software uses your device microphone only to generate real-time visual output inside your browser.

No audio is recorded

No audio is stored or saved

No audio or derived data is transmitted off-device

No sharing, uploading, or retention occurs

Audio signals are processed temporarily in-memory for visualization and then discarded immediately

This visualization does not:

create recordings or audio files

store frequency “snapshots” linked to a user or session

send audio to servers or third parties

associate microphone input with identity

Granting microphone permission enables live visual analysis only, not surveillance or monitoring.

Recommended placement locations:

near the microphone permission UI

inside a Privacy / Compliance section

in your compliance log as a standing disclosure

in a privacy.html page or COMPLIANCE.md

Suggested additional sentence:
“This software is not intended to intercept, monitor, or surveil audio and does not function as a recording tool.”

Compliance note:
Always confirm final claims against actual statute language and consult counsel for high-stakes interpretations.

FTC resource: App Developers – Start with Security
https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/app-developers-start-security

Key takeaways logged:

Security expectations vary by app, but “reasonable security” is the baseline

Third-party SDKs/libraries can introduce privacy and security gaps

App distribution increases scrutiny for privacy/security representations

Devices can be lost/stolen; secure storage and minimize retained data

Assign ownership for security tasks (even if it’s just you)

Collect only what you need; retain only as long as needed

Understand platform differences and built-in security features

Protect usernames/passwords and any authentication mechanisms
